## Binary Trees
A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. The topmost node of the tree is called the root.

In a binary tree, each child node can have either zero, one, or two child nodes of its own. This structure allows for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations. Binary trees are commonly used in computer science for implementing algorithms like binary search trees and expression trees.
